Software Development Lifecycle - SDLC
	1. Planning
	2. Analysis | Requirement Analysis (SSR) software specification requirement
	3. Design (DDR) designe document resuirement
	4. Implementation stage - building software
	5. testing | Integration
	6. Deployment | maintenance

Web App -> FrontEnd -> Console (cmd Module) in python
	-> BackEnd -> OOP concepts in Python 
	-> Database (File storage) -> (json module)
	-> Testing -> (unittest module) in python

--start--
1. planning done alredy
2. Analysis done alredy
3. Design done alredy
4. our work is to build and to test


Analysis -> AirBnB

user account -> Fields: name, email, unique_id, created_dated, uodated_date

Reviews -> unique_id

Place -> unique_id, update_dated, created_date

Amenity -> classes (attributes and methods)
	CRUD
	C=> create
	R=> Read
	U=> Update
	D=> Delete

class BaseModel():
	# define attributes that are common
	# define methods that are common

class User(BaserModel):
	# inherits all the base class attributes
	# inherits all the base class methods
	# declare the uinque attributes of this class
	# declare the unique method of this class

class Review(BaseModel):
	# inherits all the base class attributes
        # inherits all the base class methods
        # declare the uinque attributes of this class
        # declare the unique method of this class

class place(BaseMdel):
	# inherits all the base class attributes
        # inherits all the base class methods
        # declare the uinque attributes of this class
        # declare the unique method of this class

class Amenity(BaseModel):
	# inherits all the base class attributes
        # inherits all the base class methods
        # declare the uinque attributes of this class
        # declare the unique method of this class

Evreything in Python is an OBJECT
Prepare this object for storage -> Serialization (converting a python object into a json format that we can store)
				-> Deserialization

class FileStorage():
	# managing the attribuit related to file
	# managing the methifs related to file
